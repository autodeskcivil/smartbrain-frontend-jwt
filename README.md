## How to use the App
<p>
You can use the following test login details;
<br>
<b>user:</b> a@a.com
<br>
<b>password:</b> a
<br>
Or click on the 'Register' tab and create your own new login details to use instead.
<br><br>
Once logged in simply copy, then paste an image url from the web (example:  https://www.website.com/image.png) into the search input field, then click the 'DETECT' button to run the Face Detection API. [show animation???]
<br><br>
Each time you upload an image your image count value you is incremented by +1 value as the image upload count. You can view your total Image upload count in the 'View Profile' tab, along with a Rank Badge, which is fed from AWS Lambda. The Rank Badge will then change based on the current image upload count.
<p/>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rbhachu/smartbrain-frontend-jwt.git
```
<p>Once the repo has been downloaded, 'CD' to the newly downloaded project folder ('cd smartbrain-frontend'). Then execute the following command in your terminal.<p>

```sh
npm install
```


## Configuration
<p>There is a settings file in the root of the project folder called '.env' which is also know as the Enviromental Variables file.
<br><br>
Using this file you can control how you want the app to run; Remoteley or Locally.
<br><br>
To run the app Remotely, overwrite the current values in the .env file with the following values;
<br>

```sh
#FRONT-END CLIENT
REACT_APP_CLIENT_URL=https://rbhachu-smartbrain-f-master.herokuapp.com

#BACK-END SERVER
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=https://rbhachu-smartbrain-b-master.herokuapp.com

#AWS LAMDA
REACT_APP_AWS_LAMBDA=https://vqvvli950h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, to run the app Locally, overwrite the current values in the .env file with the following values; *
<br>

```sh
#FRONT-END CLIENT
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001

#BACK-END SERVER
REACT_APP_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

#AWS LAMDA
REACT_APP_AWS_LAMBDA=https://vqvvli950h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

<br>
<i>* You will also need to download the SmartBrain Back-End Server Repo and install it too. The Repo also includes full instructions on how to do this too.
Back-End Server Repo Link: https://github.com/rbhachu/smartbrain-backend-jwt</i>
</p>



## Deployment
<p>Finally, to run the app, simply execute the following command in your terminal (ensuring you are in the correct project directory too).</p>

```sh
npm start
```
<p>After a few seconds, your browser should automatically open to the following link;

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

and display the project in the browser.</p>
